                CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
              </p>

              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
                must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
                practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
